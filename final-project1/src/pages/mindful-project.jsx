                During my senior year, many of my friends were overloaded with
                coursework and incredibly stressed out. For my senior capstone
                project, I created Mindful, a mobile app where students can
                track their tasks, ideas, and find curated music/sounds to study{" "}
                <strong>
                  <i>and take breaks</i>
                </strong>
                . This app will help students finish work more efficiently to
                reduce stress and encourage breaks.{" "}

                What makes this mindfulness app different from others, is the
                combination of task organization with mindfulness.
