# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1*

![Personal Portfolio](images/portfolio.JPG)

My first idea is a website portfolio to showcase my UX work. I plan to make my design interactive
by adding interactions such as zooming in on pictures after clicking, and fun engaging animations
that happen when the user first enters the site or scrolls. For accessibility, I plan to tag all 
of my images properly and employing best coding practices when creating a hierarchy within my code.
I will also make sure that all text is accessibly to different assistive technologies. I want 
my website to include information about my different projects, resume, and overall convey that I 
would be a good person to hire as a UX desginer.

### *Idea 2*

![Food Blog](images/food-blog.JPG)

My second idea is a food blog that will showcase my family's recipes. My family has a lot of recipes
and they aren't written down anywhere so this is a good opportunity to organize them. I plan to make 
my designinteractive and engaging by allowing users to check off recipe ingredients/steps, and 
creating buttons that allow users to skip ahead to the recipe. I will make my design accessible by 
making sure my code/design works witih assistive technologies, and that content is easily skipable. 
This is especially important for this idea as the content will most likely be long.

### *Idea 3*

![Restaurant Dictionary](images/restaurant-dictionary.JPG)

My third idea is a restaurant dictionary for the city of Boston. I used to live in Boston and there
were always so many restaurants to keep track of. The website would offer insights for new restaurants 
in town as well as different categories and rankings to browse. This website would be interactive 
and engaging through reviews that the user could leave, and voting for their favorite restaurnts. I 
will make the website accessible by making sure that the design and code follow good standards and 
allow users to equally use the website.

## Feedback Summary

For the portfolio project, my classmates gave me suggestions on how to make the website more memorable 
and personable. One of my classmates suggested that I add animations to mkae it more personal to grab 
the user's attention. She mentioned that this would also be a good way to make the website more
memorable. Another classmate suggested that I could make the website more personal through images and
words that represent what I like or show my personality. The third classmate highlighted the importance
of having a balance between jargon and my own voice. 

For the food blog project, my classmates had unique takes for the overall design of the website. 
One classmate suggested that I would need to focus more on user research in order to distinguish the
design of my website from others. Another classmate suggested a more interactive interface, such as 
a digitized notecard recipe file system. This would be similar to and old-fashioned way to note down 
recipes that could be whimsical in digital format. Finally, the last classmate suggested a more clear 
organization system for the different recipes, and suggested thinking deeper about the genres of
these recipes. 

For the restaurant dictionary project, my classmates gave input on the interactions of the website. 
One classmate suggested a clearer way for the user to find the vibe of restuarant that they're 
looking for when they're on the website. This is important to consider as food is not the only 
consideration people have when deciding where to eat. Another suggested making the interface more fun 
by first considering the neighborhood within the city that someone might choose to eat at. Then, the
website could give more specific recommendations based on location.

## Feedback Digestion

For the portfolio project, I decided would incorporate the idea of adding animations to grab users'
attention. I thought back to all of the portfolios I've seen, and the ones with cooler animations
do stick out to me in my head. I think that's ideal for a portfolio. I also will consider how to make
the website more personable through different images and wording. I think a lot of portfolios can
easily blend together due to their structure and wording, so if I lean more into my own personality
perhaps I can distinguish myself from the back. I also like the idea of showcasing my own voice, as
I know its important to tell a story within my portfolio and case studies.

For the food blog project, I think some user research is important to understand how to make myself
different, but I don't think it should be a main portion of the project. As this project is to 
best practice good coding and usability practices, I think focusing on research would not help me
practice the necessary skills for this class. I also will not go in the direction of interactive 
notecards, since that tradition is not representative of my own culture and the recipes I'm thinking
of. Although, I will incorporate the feedback about a better organization system, since I feel most
users would not like a random conglomerate of recipes.

For the restaurant dictionary, I will take the critique of finding a better way for users to search
for a specific type of restaurant. If anything, I agree users most likley have an idea of how much
they want to spend and the type of cuisine they want to eat. Furthermore, I want to incorporate
the idea of starting with different neighborhoods, but I worry that could limit the users' ability
to find different restuarants. I think a better idea would be if the user could select multiple
neighborhoods at once to see more recommendations.
